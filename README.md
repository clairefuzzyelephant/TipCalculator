# Project 1 - *Tippy Tipper*

**Tippy Tipper** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Claire Cheng**

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
**I used a slider instead of the menu select to get tip amounts, since I thought it was more versatile (can take on any integer tip value between 5% and 50%) and more aesthetic as well. I also changed up the design and styles.**

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
**I think mostly the biggest thing that bothered me was that I spent too much time trying to get the slider to work which turned out aesthetic and pretty but didn't really add that much to the functionality of the app. Because I was going home with my parents after work I didn't really have time to implement the other more useful features like a settings page and default values (I did work on it in class but didn't finish debugging it, so it wasn't in my submitted github version). Other than that it was an interesting task and I enjoyed it.**
